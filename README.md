# LiveCoding Madness: Let's Build a Deep Learning Library

In this talk we'll build a deep learning library
from scratch (well, from NumPy) in 45 minutes.

How is that possible? By typing _really_ fast.

Along the way we'll talk about library design,
type hinting, Python 3.6, and of course deep learning.

# Here's the plan:

1. Tensors
2. Layers
3. Neural Nets
4. Loss Functions
5. Optimizers
6. Data
7. Training
8. XOR Example
